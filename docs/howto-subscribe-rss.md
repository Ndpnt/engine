### By RSS

You can receive notification for a specific service or document by subscribing to RSS feeds.

> An RSS feed is a type of web page that contains information about the latest content published by a website, such as the date of publication and the address where you can view it. When this resource is updated, a feed reader app automatically notifies you and you can see the update.

To find out the address of the RSS feed you want to subscribe to:

1. [Navigate](#exploring-the-versions-history) to the page with the history of changes you are interested in. _In the WhatsApp example above, this would be [this page](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commits/main/WhatsApp/Privacy%20Policy.md)._
2. Copy the address of that page from your browserâ€™s address bar. _In the WhatsApp example, this would be `https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commits/main/WhatsApp/Privacy%20Policy.md`._
3. Append `.atom` at the end of this address. _In the WhatsApp example, this would become `https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commits/main/WhatsApp/Privacy%20Policy.md.atom`._
4. Subscribe your RSS feed reader to the resulting address.
